# Introduction

This is a repository for me to learn machine learning.

## Libraries used:

```
scipy
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
sklearn
pipenv
junypter
requests
Django
pgadmin4
flask
tensorflow
```

Note that these libraries should also be in the Pipfile so be sure to check that out. Note that these installed libraries will let you run EVERYTHING in this repository.

Note we'll also need `Postgres`.

## Repositories:

### BFP (Baby's first project)

A project based on this tutorial `https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/` to get my feet wet with machine learning.

### AOE2_Stats

An Age of Empires II machine learning project that I've decided to embark on - the idea is to be able to pull win/loss records from real games online and then do STATISTICS on it.

### MNIST Tutorial

A project based on the MNIST dataset, this really is more of a tutorial to help familiarize myself with machine learning.

### Notes

A folder full of useful machine learning notes. Note (heh) that the notes live in Jupyter files. Type `jupyter-lab` in the console to activate Jupyter.
