# Introduction

This is a repository for me to learn machine learning.

## Libraries used:

```
scipy
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
sklearn
pipenv
junypter
```

Note that these libraries should also be in the Pipfile so be sure to check that out.

## Repositories:

### BFP (Baby's first project)

A project based on this tutorial `https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/` to get my feet wet with machine learning.
