    "So with machine learning, there will very often (if not always) be conversation about Test Data and Training Data. So, what's the difference between the two of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, _training_ data is what is used to _train_ a machine learning model, and _test_ data is used to see how well a model was trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Data**\n",
    "As previously mentioned, this is the data we feed into a machine learning model to train it. Ideally, with good training data, we hope to create an accurate model. Training data is a subset of your entire dataset used to teach a machine learning model to recognize patterns or to perform some sort of criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Data**\n",
    "After we've built a machine learning model using the previously mentioned training data, we need to test the model - and this is where testing data comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing data has two main criteria:\n",
    "- It should represent the entire dataset.\n",
    "- It should be large enough to generate meaningful predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test data is important because it is the final, real-world check to make sure that the machine learning model was trained effectively.\n",
    "\n",
